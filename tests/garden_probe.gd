## 星光菜园, stage one: the save. No growing yet, no screen yet -- just the
## question every other stage rests on, which is whether a garden can appear in
## a save that already has months of a child's history in it without disturbing
## any of it.
##
## The three checks here are the ones written down as stage one's acceptance:
##
##   1. an old save gains a garden and loses nothing
##   2. a new save arrives with four patches of earth and seeds to put in them
##   3. running the migration twice does not double anything
##
## The rest of the garden's acceptance list arrives with the stages that
## implement it -- growth in stage two, the screen in stage three.
